                    <h6>A food bank is a non-profit, 
                        charitable organization that distributes food to those who have difficulty purchasing enough to avoid hunger, 
                        usually through intermediaries like food pantries and soup kitchens.
                         Some food banks distribute food directly with their own food pantries.<br /><br />
                         The rise of food banks has been broadly welcomed. Not only do they provide a solution to the problem of hunger that does not require resources from the state,
                          but they can be viewed as evidence of increasing community spirit and of active, caring citizenship. In the UK for example, Patrick Butler, society editor for The Guardian,
                           has written that the rise of foodbanks has been most enthusiastically welcomed by the right,
                          but also by many on the left of the political spectrum, who were often "nervously excited" about them."Many feel they are firefighting, 
                          finding a way to deal with the logistics of feeding more and more people,
                           with no time to advocate for changes that would eradicate the need for food banks in the first place."
